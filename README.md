# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn data to identify patterns, predict at-risk customers, and recommend retention strategies. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning, we uncover key factors driving churn and build a predictive model to proactively address customer attrition.
This project is an end-to-end customer churn analysis solution for a telecom company, combining data science (Python) and business intelligence (Power BI) to identify at-risk customers and reduce attrition.
